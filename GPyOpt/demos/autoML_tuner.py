"""
This is a simple demo to demonstrate the use of Bayesian optimization with GPyOpt with some simple options. Run the example by writing:

import GPyOpt
autoML_demo = GPyOpt.demos.autoML_tuner()

As a result you should see:

- A plot comparing an OLS estimator for a simple regression problem with the obtained parameters using the automatic tuner.
- An object called autoML_demo that contains the results of the optimization process (see reference manual for details). Among the available results you have access to the GP model via


and to the location of the best found location writing.
