"""
This is a demo to demonstrate how to perform parallel Bayesian optimization with GPyOpt. Run the example by writing:

import GPyOpt
BO_demo_parallel= GPyOpt.demos.parallel_optimization()

As a result you should see:

- A plot with the model and the current acquisition function
- A plot with the diagnostic plots of the optimization.
- An object call BO_demo_auto that contains the results of the optimization process (see reference manual for details). Among the available results you have access to the GP model via

>> BO_demo_parallel.model

and to the location of the best found location writing.
