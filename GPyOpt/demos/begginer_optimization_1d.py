"""
This is a simple demo to demonstrate the use of Bayesian optimization with GPyOpt with some simple options. Run the example by writing:

import GPyOpt
BO_demo_1d = GPyOpt.demos.begginer_optimization_1d()

As a result you should see:

- A plot with the model and the current acquisition function
- A plot with the diagnostic plots of the optimization.
- An object call BO_demo_1d that contains the results of the optimization process (see reference manual for details). Among the available results you have access to the GP model via

>> BO_demo_1d.model

and to the location of the best found location writing.
