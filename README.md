GPyOpt
======

Gaussian process optimization using [GPy](http://sheffieldml.github.io/GPy/). Performs global optimization with different acquisition functions. Among other functionalities, it is possible to use GPyOpt to optimize physical experiments (sequentially or in batches) and to handle large data sets via sparse Gaussian process models.
