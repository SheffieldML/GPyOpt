## Manual

The GPyOpt reference manual has been written using [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) to help you to interact with the code and use it to run your own experiments. 

Locally, we recommend to star the reference manual using

```bash
$ cd GPyOpt/manual
$ jupyter notebook index
```

On-line, you can also check the [GPyOpt reference manual](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/SheffieldML/GPyOpt/blob/devel/manual/index.ipynb).


## On-line documentation

Check the [GPyOpt documentation](http://pythonhosted.org/GPyOpt/) for details of the different functionalities.
